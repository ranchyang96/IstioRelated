The most important parts of the codes are in security, pilot, mixer directories, istioctl also includes some CLIs.
So during the analysis, we only focus on these codes.

System calls:
os.Exit() in istio/istio
syscall.Read() in istio/istio
syscall.Write() in istio/istio
There are loads of system calls in the syscall package and we can just find them according to the package.

Wrong updates:
Global variables are mostly defined in main.go.
There are 50+ main.go files in the istio/istio repo.
Global variables are defined by var or in a large ''var'' list.
A few examples: exitCode in adapterlinter, port, address, logoptions in policybackend, etc.

Operating system events:
os.Remove
os.Setenv
os.File
os.Stat
This is somehow overlapped with system calls. open and read, close and exit.

information processing:
There are loads of URL.path in pilot and security, usually used in requests and ms.
They are defined as pure String. We can parse them and modify a little part in the case.
