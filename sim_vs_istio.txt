In the simulator, it's assumed that each pod has one application, no pod abstraction implemented.
Only one kind of protocol including retransmission is simulated, no other protocols and load balancing are implemented.
Fault injection contains only delays, while Istio also has aborts (this should be easy to add).
A few interfaces are left (like heartbeats) but not completely implemented. Fault Detection and automatic health checks should be able to simulated with them.
No security feature is seen.
Logs are only printed inside apps, which are not complete.
Monitoring for connections and heartbeats are missing.
Direct memory access is used instead of actual traffic.

No control plane features are covered.
The simulator covers only the service mesh part.
In the notion of fault injection for all kind of bugs in data planes, this is somewhat enough.
It's really hard to decide which parts are missing and should be extended.
