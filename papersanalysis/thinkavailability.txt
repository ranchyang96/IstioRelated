Thinking about Availability in Large Service Infrastructures
Google MTV

1  Introduction
cloud current states and applications
necessity for e2e approach to availability
structure of the paper

1.1Context
motivation to improve availability: more people rely on SaaS services, growth of IaaS makes availability more critical

2  A simple case study
Figure of Traffic Engineering infrastructure

3  Defining infrastructural availability
definition of availability: SLO: (SL Indicators, comparator, threshold) while real-world SLO are multi-dimensional

3.1Reasons for multi-dimensional SLOs
Performance and availability

3.2Dimensionality reduction
tiered SLO

3.3Choosing sub-system SLOs
top-level SLOs to individual SLOs for component sub-systems

3.4Tactical vs strategic SLOs
Questions to discuss, somewhat gives the answer

4  Availability is like security ... somewhat
threat model, hard to anticipate, immunity to future ones

4.1Analogous operational practices
requires good adherence to good operational practices
reviews give good security, penetration tests (disaster recovery)

5  Past research: successes and gaps
router protocol, performance and scaling
taxonomies of metrics

6  Techniques for improving availability
key insights
not in one layer, integrated solution
fail static
avoid cyclic dependencies

6.1Availability is not just avoiding failure
also when mean time to repair is too high

7  Next Steps
multidimensional SLI
sub-system SLOs
prediction whether it meets SLO
decision of the usage of design patterns
