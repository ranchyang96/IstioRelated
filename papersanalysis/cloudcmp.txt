CloudCmp: Shopping for a Cloud Made Easy
Abstract:
help customers estimate performance without actually deploying the app
Introduction:
 * cloud computing background, motivation
 * service models, pricing models, workloads difference
 * proposed framework
 * measurements and comparison
	- AWS, Azure, AppEngine, CloudServers, CloudSites, GoGrid
Cloud Computing Services
 *********** table about four services
	- Elastic Compute Cluster: free CPU hours given
	- Persistent Storage Service: operation's complexity
	- Intra-Cloud Network
	- Wide-area Delivery Work
CloudCamp Framework
- Service Benchmark
 * Java for a standard set of CPU, memory and I/O tasks
- Application Workload Collection
 * collect request trace and execution path
- Performance Prediction
 * with previous generated profile in service benchmarking, estimate the time and costs of each component on the execution path
 * figure of estimation shown
Benchmarking Results
 *********** figures of benchmarking result (time and costs, scaling)
 *********** figure of persistent storage service (entry number, insert/fetch)
 *********** table of throughput
 *********** figure of RTT cumulative fraction
